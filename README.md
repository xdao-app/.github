# About XDAO

XDAO is a multichain DAO builder for jointly managing crypto assets and DeFi projects. XDAO's key smart contracts and child DAOs are verified on all blockchain explorers. Notice that XDAO contracts have the same addresses in all networks.

Security is our general priority, that is why we are auditing all our smart contracts, including modules. Our audits ([Pessimistic Audit](https://github.com/xdao-app/xdao-contracts/blob/master/audits/pessimistic/pessimistic.pdf) and [Hacken Audit](https://github.com/xdao-app/xdao-contracts/blob/master/audits/hacken/hacken.pdf)) are available on GitHub.  Nevertheless, user and developer experience is crucial for us, so we are constantly upgrading our UI and writing new modules in order to make XDAO the most efficient platform for our users. The best way to get an impression about it is to [try out XDAO](https://www.xdao.app) - it should only take 2 minutes.
